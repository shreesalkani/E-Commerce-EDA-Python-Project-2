# EDA-e-commerce-project
Firstly, What is EDA? EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis is preliminary step in data analysis to summarize main characteristic of the data, gain better understanding of the data, uncover relationships between variables and see important variables in the data. In short, it is a good practice to look at the data and try to extract as much meaning from it as possible. E-Commerce Data To share my perspective on the concepts and techniques I know, I used an international data set based in the UK under the heading “Online Retail” in the UCI Machine Learning Repository that includes all transactions that took place between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. I accessed this dataset directly from Kaggle.
